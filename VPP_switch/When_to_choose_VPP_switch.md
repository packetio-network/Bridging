## when should you opt VPP to switch the ttraffic ?
The choice between FD.io VPP, Linux kernel bridge, OVS-DPDK, and other networking technologies depends on the specific needs and constraints of the use case. Here are a few factors to consider:

### Performance: 
  FD.io VPP is designed to provide high performance packet processing. It uses a vector processing model, which can provide better throughput and lower latency than traditional packet processing methods. If performance is a key requirement, VPP might be a good choice. DPDK-enabled solutions like OVS-DPDK can also provide high performance, but they may require more fine-tuning and setup.

### Feature Set: 
  VPP has a rich feature set, supporting a wide range of protocols and functions including routing, switching, load balancing, NAT, IPSec, and more. If you need advanced networking features or flexibility to add custom features, VPP can be a good choice.

### Ease of Use/Integration: 
  Linux kernel bridge is integrated into the Linux kernel and is relatively easy to use and manage. It may be a good choice for simpler networking needs, or when integration with other Linux-based tools or environments is a priority.

### Scalability: 
  FD.io VPP is designed to be highly scalable and can handle large amounts of network traffic efficiently, making it suitable for use cases with high scale requirements.

### Community and Support: 
  All three options have strong community support. However, depending on your organization's needs and resources, one might have more attractive support options than the others.
